# Project Title: Laravel Category Management

## Project Overview:

This Laravel web application manages categories, providing features for creating, editing, showing, and deleting categories. The project follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern.

## Features:

   - Delete categories with a confirmation step.

## Technologies Used:

1. **Laravel Framework:**
   - Laravel serves as the primary PHP web application framework.

2. **Database:**
   - The application uses a relational database (likely MySQL) for storing and retrieving category information.

3. **Blade Templating Engine:**
   - Blade is employed as the templating engine to create views and templates.

4. **Query Builder:**
   - Laravel's Query Builder is utilized for database interactions, providing a fluent interface to construct SQL queries.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
